Project history
===============

The :mod:`cpp-netlib` was founded by Dean Michael Berris in 2007.
Initially it consisted of a message template and an HTTP client.  It
found a home on Sourceforge_ but was migrated at the end of 2009 to
Github_ where development is actively continued by a committed
community.
