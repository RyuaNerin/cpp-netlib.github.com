The message template
====================

One of the core components in the library is the concept and the implementation
of a common message type. In most (not all) network protocols, the concept of a
message is central to the definition of the protocol. In HTTP, SMTP, XMPP, and
even other protocols like SNMP and ICMP, there is a common notion of a "packet"
or a message. In cpp-netlib we chose to implement the concept of a message that
has the following common parts:

  * **Source** - every message has a source identifier which varies from
    protocol to protocol.

  * **Destination** - every message has a destination identifier which varies
    from protocol to protocol.

  * **Headers** - each message is assumed to contain headers, which may be empty
    in cases where the protocol does not support it, but is nonetheless
    supported by cpp-netlib messages.

  * **Body** - the content area of a message which varies from protocol to
    protocol (also sometimes referred to as payload).

This division is purely logical -- in the underlying implementation, the message
type can choose to have different means of storing the data, dependinn on the
type used to tag the message. This section covers the `Message Concept`_ as well
as the `Basic Message`_ implementation.

Message Concept
```````````````

The Message Concept specifies what the valid operations on a message are as well
as what messages look like semantically. The following table summarize the
operations and syntactic as well as semantic properties of messages.

**Legend**

:M: The message type.
:m,n: An instance of **M**.
:S: A string type.
:s,k,v: An instance of **S**.

+------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------+

+------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------+
| m << header(k, v);     | ``M &``              | Add a header to m.                  |
+------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------+
| m << remove_header(k); | ``M &``              | Remove a header from m.             |
+------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------+
| m << body(s);          | ``M &``              | Set the body of m.                  |

Types that model the Message Concept are meant to encapsulate data that has a
source, a destination, one or more named headers, and a body/payload. Because
the accessors and the directives are not required to be part of the message type
that models the Message Concept, a message can be implemented as a POD type and
have all manipulations performed in the directive implementations, as well as
value transformations done in the accessors.

Basic Message
`````````````
The default implementation of a simple type that models the Message Concept is
available in cpp-netlib. This default implementation is named ``basic_message``
which supports a ``Tag`` template parameter. The definition of ``basic_message`` 
looks like this:

.. code-block:: c++

    template <class Tag>
    class basic_message;

The ``basic_message`` template requires that the following tag-dispatched
metafunctions are defined for the type ``Tag``:

.. code-block:: c++

    template <class Tag>
    struct string;

    template <class Tag>
    struct headers_container;

All the operations defined by the message concept are implemented by this basic
message type. Other message implementations can either use this common message
type or specialize it according to whether they want to use different containers
or whether it's going to be just a POD type.
